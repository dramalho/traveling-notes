# Transportation

* [Dart](http://www.irishrail.ie) - Provides urban and regional train transportation in and out of Dublin. There's one line running from North to South, mostly next to the sea and one line to the West across the middle of the country.
* [Luas](http://www.luas.ie/) is the urban tram system, there are two separate lines (with works going to merge the two)
* [Dublin Bus](http://www.dublinbus.ie/) covers most of the Dublin area but it's obviously the slowest of the available options
* [Leap Card](https://www.leapcard.ie/en/Home.aspx) - the leap card lets you ride any of the options above, you simply top it up with money and tap when entering and leaving the transport. Might be worth checking the [visitor card](https://www.leapcard.ie/en/PageSetting/ContentViewer.aspx?Val=W2YN67IrBnhwjbdYS7EvW6LkRbNNu0ZwG9upvDwq7Yg05KYQYKAkdN%2bVbAdPSVYS7hUIcvAyUqH5XYb%2b9GUpeCoV1yxijLqkRorYEWB%2bJXRSc2xfitBhZCGyuebfW7ZBJzbz8FHnwGIG50Dyq2op08ZSsgw47LO753h27CkUIxE%3d) as it provides unlimited traveling for three days (I assume you can top-it off after)
* Taxis are easy to find - Hailo / Uber also operate here
* [Dublin Bikes](http://www.dublinbikes.ie/) - Accessible bike scheme where you can take a bike from any of the [many points around the city](http://www.dublinbikes.ie/All-Stations/Station-map) and ride through Dublin. There's a [3 day ticket](http://www.dublinbikes.ie/Subscription/The-3-Day-Ticket/3-Day-Ticket-Users) available.

# Orientation tips

Dublin has the Irish Sea to the right with the River Liffey crossing the city right at the middle in a straight line, So it's generally easy to know you're going South / North / East and West based on where the river is.

## Destinations
